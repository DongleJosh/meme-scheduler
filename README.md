## Description
Challenge week 5. I really had no idea what I was doing so I worked with some other people in the group and atleast got some of the functionality working

Then I just messed with Javascript until i found some way to make the time change colors I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it but i think it works

Sorry for letting you down again
